> Testing stacks with todo apps. Inspired by [realworld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) & [todomvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc)

## Goal

I'm writing plethora of TODO apps with quite random stacks. The mian idea is to refresh stuff & check out stacks I would not normally use.

## Subprojects

- **db-\***
- **api-\***
- **ui-\***
- **app-\***
- **lib-\***
- **lang-\***

## Common stack

Randomising everything would be simply to much...

- typescript
- graphql
- eslint

## Build

- shell scripts may (or may not?) be written for linux
- some database modules need those databases configured
- lang-\* packages need those languages installed and configured
